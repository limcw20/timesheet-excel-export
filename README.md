# Export for Timesheet
<strong>ISSUE:</strong>
</br>
I spend a lot of time manually editing my Excel timesheet at work every month (e.g. edit details such as dates, days, row highlights, etc.)

Currently, I do not foresee a need for a database, as there is no reason to retain the timesheets after submission.
